This code creates a password generator using Tkinter for the GUI. It starts by importing the necessary 
modules: tkinter, string, and random. The generate_password function is defined to handle the password generation process. Inside the function, 
a try block is used to catch errors. The length of the password is taken from the entry widget and converted to an integer. If the length is less than 1, 
a ValueError is raised. If valid, an empty list called password is created. A for loop runs for the length of the password, selecting a random letter, symbol, 
and digit in each iteration. These characters are appended to the password list. After the loop, the list is joined into a string and sliced to the specified length.
The result is displayed in the label. If an invalid length is entered, an error message is shown.
The main part of the code creates the GUI. The root window is initialized with tk.Tk() and its size is set to 400x300 pixels. 
An entry label is created with the text "Enter password length:" and placed in the grid layout. An entry widget for user input is created and placed in the grid. 
A button labeled "Generate Password" is created and linked to the generate_password function. It is placed in the grid. 
A label to display the generated password is created with a specific font style and placed in the grid. 
Finally, the main event loop is started with root.mainloop(), keeping the GUI responsive to user interactions.
